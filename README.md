Module 20 Challenge
Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting loan risk categories, to classify loans as either healthy loan (label 0) or high-risk (label 1). This evaluation helps  the company to make  lending decisions.
Results
•	Accuracy Score: 0.99
•	Precision Score:
•	Healthy Loan (0): 1.00
•	High-Risk Loan (1): 0.87
•	Recall Score:
•	Healthy Loan (0): 1.00
•	High-Risk Loan (1): 0.95
Summary of Results
The logistic regression model demonstrates exceptional performance,  in identifying healthy loans. While the model also shows strong performance for high-risk loans, with a recall of 95%, the precision of 87% indicates that there are some false positives.

Given the high accuracy and the strong ability to correctly identify healthy loans, I recommend using this model for the company’s lending decisions. The model's performance ensures that the majority of loans will be classified accurately. If there is  improvement in the prediction of high-risk loans, the overall results suggest that this model will add significant value to the company’s risk assessment process.

Further enhancements could be pursued to improve the precision for high-risk loans.
